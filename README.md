## 🌟 Angular 17 Fullstack Project 

Welcome to the InproCode project repository. This project is split into two main parts:

- **Frontend**: Angular 17 application with Mapbox, FullCalendar, and Chart.js.
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express) server with a MySQL database.

çThis project showcases an Angular 17 standalone application that integrates a Mapbox map, FullCalendar for event management, and Chart.js for data visualization. It is connected to a backend server for fetching and storing data, making it a complete full-stack application.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

·Node.js (v16.x or later)
·npm (v7.x or later)
·Angular CLI (v17.x or later)
